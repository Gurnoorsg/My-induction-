Conclusion

Day 4 of the induction programme was a well-rounded experience. It not only provided useful academic insights but also focused on our physical, mental, and emotional well-being. The welcoming and inclusive environment made me feel more connected to GNDEC. I am excited about the journey ahead and look forward to growing through such engaging initiatives.

Induction Day 5 Report

The fifth day of the induction program started with a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) session conducted by our seniors. They guided us through the basics of C++ programming and explained important syntax in a simple and effective way. It was a friendly and interactive session, and we felt comfortable asking questions. Learning directly from seniors made the experience even more relatable and engaging.

After that, we had our Beef lecture, where Ma’am came and introduced herself. She told us about her background and the subject she will be teaching. Her way of talking was clear and confident, which made us feel more connected. She also encouraged us to focus on learning and take the subject seriously.

Our next lecture was supposed to be a Mathematics class, but the regular math teacher was on leave. In his place, an adjustment teacher came. She did not take any lecture but simply introduced herself to the class and had a short interaction with us. It was a light and relaxed session.

Overall, the day was filled with new experiences, helpful insights from seniors, and introductions to new faculty members. I’m looking forward to more engaging sessions in the coming days.

Induction Day 6 Report

The sixth day of our induction program began with a Mathematics lecture. Our regular Math Sir joined us and continued sharing useful knowledge. He revised some basic concepts and once again discussed three helpful mobile or web applications that we can use in future classes. These apps will assist us in creating 2D and 3D graphs, making it easier to visualize and understand complex math problems.

The next lecture was a change from the regular schedule. We had a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) session conducted by our seniors. In this session, they taught us about for loops and if-else statements in C++ programming. Their explanation was clear and included step-by-step examples, which made the concepts easy to understand. After this session, we had our regular break.

Post-break, we all assembled in the auditorium where a college trustee delivered an inspiring motivational speech. He emphasized the importance of hard work, discipline, and making the most of the opportunities offered by the college. After his speech, a professor came and gave us important details about the CML program. He also introduced us to the NPTEL website, which provides free online courses and certifications.
