# Day 3: Inspiration through Experience

Date: Saturday
Time: 9:00 AM onwards

Lecture 1: Learning Science & Math Experimentally

Speaker: Dr. Jaswinder Singh “JaswinS”
Recognitions:

National & State Awardee

Honoured by President of India

Popular Science Educator, Govt. of India

Multi Gyan Peth & Asian Excellence Award Winner


Session Highlights:

Dr. Singh blended science, mathematics, and spirituality, motivating students to adopt a disciplined learning routine.

# Lecture 2: Universal Human Values
Speaker: Priya Ma’am

Core Theme:
Understanding and aligning one’s life with the Basic Aspiration — continuous happiness and prosperity — rather than chasing disconnected short-term goals.

Activity Reflection:
Participants reviewed personal aspirations (चाहना) and concerns (चिंता). A common pattern emerged:

Aspirations:

Academic excellence
Good job with high salary
Family pride and personal happiness
Concerns:

Peer pressure
Lack of confidence
Time constraints
Stage fear
Lack of discipline
The "Why?" Chain of Reflection:
What are you doing? → e.g., Studying hard
Why? → To become an engineer
Why? → To earn money and respect
Why? → To be happy and prosperous
This reflective chain led to the realization that:

All efforts ultimately aim at achieving lasting happiness and prosperity.

Life Planning Approaches:
Linear (1 → 2 → 3 → 4): Acting without deeper clarity of purpose
Reverse (4 → 3 → 2 → 1): Starting with clarity of aspiration, then planning steps
The reverse approach was emphasized as more effective and resilient during setbacks (e.g., failing to get into a dream college or not getting a preferred roommate).

## Key Takeaways:
Understand your Basic Aspiration clearly
View career and academic achievements as means, not the end
If one path fails, find another without losing purpose
Reflect on past disappointments to evaluate your reaction and growth
Assignment:
Reflect on whether continuous happiness and prosperity is your true aspiration
Recall a moment when a desired path closed and analyze your response

# Induction Day 5 Report

The fifth day of the induction program started with a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) session conducted by our seniors. They guided us through the basics of C++ programming and explained important syntax in a simple and effective way. It was a friendly and interactive session, and we felt comfortable asking questions. Learning directly from seniors made the experience even more relatable and engaging.

After that, we had our Beef lecture, where Ma’am came and introduced herself. She told us about her background and the subject she will be teaching. Her way of talking was clear and confident, which made us feel more connected. She also encouraged us to focus on learning and take the subject seriously.

Our next lecture was supposed to be a Mathematics class, but the regular math teacher was on leave. In his place, an adjustment teacher came. She did not take any lecture but simply introduced herself to the class and had a short interaction with us. It was a light and relaxed session.

Overall, the day was filled with new experiences, helpful insights from seniors, and introductions to new faculty members. I’m looking forward to more engaging sessions in the coming days.

# Induction Day 6 Report

The sixth day of our induction program began with a Mathematics lecture. Our regular Math Sir joined us and continued sharing useful knowledge. He revised some basic concepts and once again discussed three helpful mobile or web applications that we can use in future classes. These apps will assist us in creating 2D and 3D graphs, making it easier to visualize and understand complex math problems.

The next lecture was a change from the regular schedule. We had a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) session conducted by our seniors. In this session, they taught us about for loops and if-else statements in C++ programming. Their explanation was clear and included step-by-step examples, which made the concepts easy to understand. After this session, we had our regular break.

Post-break, we all assembled in the auditorium where a college trustee delivered an inspiring motivational speech. He emphasized the importance of hard work, discipline, and making the most of the opportunities offered by the college. After his speech, a professor came and gave us important details about the CML program. He also introduced us to the NPTEL website, which provides free online courses and certifications.

# Induction Day 7 Report

The seventh day of the induction program began with a session in the college auditorium. The speakers provided detailed information about the various scholarships and facilities available to students. This session was very informative and helped everyone understand how to access financial and academic support.

After that, a faculty member introduced the Digital Marketing Program. The session covered the basics of digital marketing, its growing importance in the modern world, and how students can explore it as a potential career option. The session was engaging and gave new insight into fields beyond engineering.

Later, another professor gave an overview of the examination process. Important points such as the exam pattern, rules, grading system, and attendance requirements were discussed. This helped us understand how the academic evaluation will be conducted throughout the course.

After a short break, a Chemistry lecture was held. The professor explained the syllabus and covered a few introductory topics, giving us a head start in the subject. The session was clear and easy to follow.

Finally, we had a Mathematics lecture. We learned some important formulas and concepts that will be useful in upcoming classes. Overall, the day was well-organized and very informative.

## Key Points of Day 7:

Session on college scholarships and student facilities

Introduction to the Digital Marketing Program

Explanation of the examination process and rules

Chemistry lecture covering syllabus and basic topics

Mathematics lecture focusing on important formulas

Productive and informative day for all students

# Day 8 Induction Report

The eighth day of my induction program began with our very first BEE (Basic Electrical Engineering) lecture. Our ma’am introduced us to the basics of electronic devices and provided an overview of the syllabus for this subject. She also guided us on which types of books we should prefer for better understanding and long-term learning. Her advice on selecting the right study material will be very helpful throughout the semester.

After this interesting and informative lecture, we proceeded to the TCC Seminar Hall. Here, we were asked to provide our Aadhaar card details as part of the process for college ID card formation. The procedure was organized and quick, ensuring that all students completed the requirement without difficulty.

Since the documentation process did not take much time, our classes ended earlier than usual. Although it was a shorter day, it was still productive. We gained knowledge about a new subject, understood its syllabus, and also completed an important step towards receiving our official college ID card.

Overall, Day 8 was a mix of academic learning and administrative work, contributing to both our studies and campus life.
